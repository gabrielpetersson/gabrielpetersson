### **Timeline highlights**

*17-18yrs old:*

-   Dropped out of high school to join as  a founding team member of Depict.ai (YC S20), which currently is the largest ML company in Scandinavia w ~40 employees. 
-   Was one of two who built our first product recommender system, using both image cnn & other content based techniques

*18-19yrs old:* 

-   Founded & built hittavaran.com, the largest price comparison site w/ scraping for hand sanitizers and masks in Sweden during covid, generated $24'000 in 3 weeks.
-   Reached 5% of the Swedish population in impressions on viral-engineered FB posts plugging the site, reaching 32k unique visitors in the first week
-   At the same time I built & owned the video-call product troubleshooter at [Mavenoid](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/30/mavenoid-which-automates-technical-support-and-onboarding-for-hardware-companies-raises-30m/), basically zoom but w features such as live painting through webrtc

*19-20yrs old:*
-   Recruited to become interim <ins>CTO of Curb Food</ins>, which was the largest cloud kitchen in Sweden at the time w/ 80 employees
-   Built a team of 7 engineers from scratch 
-   Launched a full kitchen management system into production in all kitchens
-   Built a Doordash-style customer app

*20-22yrs old:* 
-   Founding engineer at Dataland (YC), building a developer-first Airtable focused on performance - loading hundred of thousands of rows in seconds
-   Built search/sort/filter. 5 filters and 5 sorts took 150ms at 200k rows (js is actually super fast when done right. V8s JIT etc is a masterpiece)
-   Took inspiration from the internal workings of chrome, basically building a browser in a browser. Chrome uses skia internally to paint content, and being written in C++, it can be compiled into webassembly. Wrote the GPU calls in rust. Scrolls & renders rows at 60fps on a x6 cpu slowdown.
